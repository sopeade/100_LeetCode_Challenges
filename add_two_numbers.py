# Add two Numbers

# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
#
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,0,8]
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
